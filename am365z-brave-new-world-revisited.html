Brave New World By Aldous Leonard Huxley For those who have not read it, Huxley revisits Brave New World (written in 1931) in 1958 and goes over an array of fascinating topics. From propaganda in a democratic society to brainwashing, he gives a calm yet fascinating view of the possible scientific dictatorship of the future. Amazing stuff.

I'm currently reading it, in all honesty I like it more than Brave New World. Huxley does a great job expanding upon the ideas of BNW, pointing out how accurate his predictions were, and describing how methods of population control are exercised on us all.
